## Web Tools

### `web_search`
Fast real-time search for current events, fact-checking, and finding URLs.
- Use specific keywords without filler words
- Avoid search operators like `site:` — use the `domains` parameter instead

### `web_scraper`
Extract full text content from a specific URL for detailed analysis.
- Use when you need the complete content of a page found via search
- Useful for reading articles, documentation, or any webpage in full

### Usage Guidelines

| Need | Tool |
|------|------|
| Quick facts, recent events, finding URLs | `web_search` |
| Full content from a known URL | `web_scraper` |

Use tools iteratively: search → identify promising sources → scrape for full details → refine search if needed.
